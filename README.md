# Portfolio Overview

• Cisco Webex Teams Chatbot.
I have developed a virtual assistant using Dialogflow to promote automation and decrease my workload as client infrastructure management transformation lead for a world's leading financial institution. (Confidential)

• 'What's in the fridge?' Object Detection.
Leveraging on transfer learning, I trained an image classifier which can recognize vegetables &amp; fruits at state of the art accuracy (+90%). The algorithm is build on top of the Fastai library and run in the cloud on a Colab GPU.

• Titanic survival rate prediction & Data Visualization
I have worked with the Titanic dataset from Kaggle to build a model that combines supervised and unsupervised learning to predict the survival rate of an individual. I have represented my results using Matplotlib &amp; Seaborn libraries.

• Forest type mapping
I have used the output data of a study which classified different forest types based on their spectral characteristics at visible-to-near infrared wavelengths, using ASTER satellite imagery. The aim was to identify and/or quantify the ecosystem services (e.g. carbon storage, erosion protection) provided by the forest. I have achieved my goal leveraging on Decision Tree Classifier, Cross Validation, Random Forest &amp; XG Boost.

• Ionosphere Data Wrangling
I analysed a dataset that describes the status of free electrons passing through the ionosphere to study its Summary Statistics, Principal Component Analysis and Outliers. Finally, I created a multi-boxplot of the ionosphere measurement fields.

• Temperature forecast
A Simple High and Low temperature prediction using linear regression.
